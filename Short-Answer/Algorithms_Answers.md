#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)Linear - O(n): 
This is linear because n is a constant variable.


b)Quadratic - O(n^2):
Due to the nested for loops, this is quadratic due to n being a given range.


c)Linear - O(n):
This is linear because bunnies is always a set number, so despite being called recursively, bunnies goes down in a line to base.
