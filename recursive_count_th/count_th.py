'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
def count_th(word):
    
    # TBC
    # if the word is too short, return 0 (set base)
    # if the first two letters are 'th', return 1 + recursive search at index to the right of 1
    # otherwise return recursive search at index to the right of 1
